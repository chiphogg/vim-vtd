# VTD

Vimming Things Done: a GTD-ish system which lives in vim, based on the
`vimwiki` plugin.

## Current status

Not-even-remotely alpha yet.  Still hacking around.

But I _have_ built a working GTD using Vim before.  Half of the work here 

## Should _you_ use it?

Rule #1 to keep in mind: __this is written to be *my personal* productivity
system__.  I'm mainly writing it for me.

_Mainly._

But lots of hackers use GTD, and lots use Vim, so I'm making this available in
case others find it useful.  It's also a good way to practice writing vim plugins.

As long as you keep rule #1 in mind, I'd love to hear any feedback.

## GTD

  - Obviously, 
     [David Allen's original book]
     (https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GETTING-THINGS-DONE-PAPERBACK-p-16175.php)
  - [Leo Babauta](http://leobabauta.com/), for
     [making GTD more accessible]
     (http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/)
  - I got the "Thoughts" inbox from
     [Thinking Rock GTD software](http://www.trgtd.com.au/),
     which I explored a few years ago.
     
## Coding

  - [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).  Vimscript was always impenetrable to
    me.  Then I found Steve's 
    [advice for Writing Vim Plugins]
    (http://stevelosh.com/blog/2011/09/writing-vim-plugins/),
    and his thorough tutorial,
    ["Learn Vimscript the Hard Way"]
    (http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
    Finally, a foothold!
  - [Tim Pope](http://tpo.pe/).   I must use about a million of his plugins.
    Not to mention, he *saved Vim plugins* when he wrote
    [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/).
    I use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle/) instead because it
    handles synchronization better, but even vundle was inspired by pathogen.
    *tpope showed the way.*
