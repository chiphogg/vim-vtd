# Template contexts file for VTD: Vimming Things Done

# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored (as are blank lines).
# Place contexts-to-include on a single line.
# Contexts-to-exclude start with a minus sign.

# Example: for my work computer, I might uncomment the following lines:
#work
#-home
# This would mean anything with '@work' would be included,
# while any line with '@home' will be skipped.
